# About BackendCapstone

Dear reviewer:

I completed all exercises and followed exactly the instructions. However, I think I must study more about how the APIs work, because even when I completed successfully all, there are some aspects I haven't understood yet. For example, I don't know if it's a requirement to complete the website (probably you note the website is not totally functional even if one complete all exercises), as filling the urls that have an "#" in the href in index.html. If you evaluate me with a bad me, please explain detailed what are the incomplete aspects, how I can complete them and if you have some time, recommend me some reading to be success with the goal.

## Note:

Previously to review the work, you should have to change a few details in the Database configurations. If you don't, obviously nothing will work.
